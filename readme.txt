Run GenerateProject.bat to build the project
I havent tested it in anything other than visual studio 2017
if you have an older version of the visual studio edit the .bat file to "premake5.exe vs{your version of vs}" eg  "call premake5.exe vs2015"

I want to add a cmake file to the project so it is easier to set up.

This project uses raycasting techniques like those in wolfenstein. It is my way of learning more about C++ and SFML I am sure that there are many things I could be doing better
if you happen to stumble upon this project I am open to suggestions.
